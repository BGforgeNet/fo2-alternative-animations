This repository contains some alternative animations for Fallout 2.

- Walking speed fix from [here](https://github.com/rotators/fallout-animations/tree/master/Generic_Fo2_WalkFix). Fix is done by deleting some frames from the frms, as opposed to increasing FPS.
- Faster Goris derobing cut, leaving about 1/3 of the original frames.
