This repository contains some alternative animations for Fallout 2.

- Walking speed fix from [here](https://github.com/rotators/fallout-animations/tree/master/Generic_Fo2_WalkFix). Fix is done by deleting some frames from the frms, as opposed to increasing FPS.
- Faster Goris derobing, sourced from RP 1.2. Same change, many frames are deleted.
